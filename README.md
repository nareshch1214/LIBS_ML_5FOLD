# LIBS_ML_5FOLD
This repository contains a MATLAB-based workflow for the classification of LIBS (Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy) spectral data. The process involves Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, followed by the evaluation of multiple machine learning models using cross-validation.
